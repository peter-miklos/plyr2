# PLYR2

Plyr2 is a mobile friendly web app that connects like-minded, sport enthusiasts.
Targeted at providing a solution to the problem of wanting to play tennis, ping
pong or indeed any sport you desire, but being unable to find a partner,
Plyr2 is an elegant, scalable answer to a common summer problem.

Plyr2 is a social media platform that enables users to both invite others to play with them and view other's requests on an interactive map. After picking their preferred sport, a user decides the date, time, location and skill level of their event, as well as space for any additional comments:

This is displayed with a nice, little logo on a google API-rendered map. Other users can then view these prospective events, and decide if they want to participate:

Working under the assumption that people won't just use the site to see a picture of London with pretty logos, a request to play will be made by another user, who can include a personal message to the creator if they so choose. The person who created event then decides whether to accept or not. A log is kept of a user's past events so they are free to reminisce at their leisure:
